% fits a reinforcement learning model to a multi-option choice paradigm
% inputs:
%
% Qfun is a handle to a function that accepts a vector of parameters, a
% vector of choice indices, and a vector of outcomes, and returns 
% the action values, Q
% 
% choice is a vector, one entry per trial, the index of the chosen option
%
% outcome is a set of outcomes for each trial
%
% lb and ub are vectors of upper and lower bounds on parameters
%
% niter (optional) is the number of random restarts to use in fitting
%
% ispresentx (optional) is a vector, one per trial, indicating options present
% (1 if present, 0 if not present)
% 
% outputs:
%
% beta is the vector of fitted model parameters; first entry is the softmax
% inverse temperature, followed by parameters of the model
%
% LL is the log likelihood of the data (choice, outcome) given beta
% 
% Q is a trials x options matrix of action values
